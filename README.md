# Cotributer
This is hoestly just some fun repo to make a possible future recruiter or other viewer smile.
Also it shows that I know how to properly work with github workflows to automate simple tasks.

The committer.py file gets run once a day and updates the contribute_here.txt file.
The changes get pushed and create a cool little image in my github profile :)
